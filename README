ZModem integration for iTerm 2
------------------------------

This script can be used to automate ZModem transfers from your OSX desktop to a server that can run lrzsz (in theory, any machine 
that supports SSH).

Setup is pretty simple:

1) Save the iterm2-send-zmodem.sh in /usr/local/bin/

2) Set this up as as a Trigger in iTerm 2 like so:

    Regular expression: [\$#] rz( -v)?$
    Action: Run Coprocess
    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/iterm2-send-zmodem.sh
